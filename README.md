# HowTomcatWorks
source code of the book *How Tomcat Works*.

I am trying to update the code of this book to modern Java style, so that
it looks good when I open the code in an IDE, just like IntelliJ IDEA.

I migrate the source code to a maven project, for simply managing the dependencies.

Just like the code, upgrading the dependencies is still in work.
